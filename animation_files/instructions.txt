INTRODUCTION:
------------
An animation file is a file that specifies/marks all of the animations used
to animate the scenes in this project. In marking up an animation file, the
use of whitespace is important; I would recommend following the guidelines
specified in this text document exactly, but there might be some room for
slack otherwise.

Each scene will have its own animation file written, as well as a specific
scene-id that is used to identify it. The following sections will show how
to create a new scene with a scene-id. This scene-id will be used to navigate
among different scenes. Note that the scene-id must be a whole number that's
greater than or equal to 0: {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

Other than a scene-id, there is also what's called a line-id, which identifies
a line within an animation file with a specific number. This number has to be
a whole number greater than or equal to 0, similar to a scene-id. This line-id
will be used to reference a specific line within the same animation file
document, and will allow you to manipulate the flow of the animation itself.

A final id type that is used within animation files are character-ids. These
are one-word id types which are used to reference specific characters within
the current scene being processed. (You can still use numbers to identify
them, but I didn't really want us to get mixed up between line-ids and
character-ids.) When modifying a certain character such as its size, location,
or appearance, you reference it using its unique character-id.

If you think we should add more commands or modify certain commands, just
let me know and we'll hopefully figure out a way to do that.

FYI, if you find that an uncaught exception is thrown (it'll show up in the
console with some nasty error message, or if you're using BlueJ it'll show up
in red text at the bottom), let me know and I'll make sure it's caught.

BASIC STRUCTURE:
---------------

ANIMATION [scene-id] [background-name]
// insert code here
return [next-scene-id]

- scene-id: A number assigned to the scene this animation file defines;
            the scene-id 0 is the first scene animated.
- background-name: The name of the background image first displayed in this scene.
- next-scene-id: The scene-id of the next scene to animate; -1 to quit.

Some basic structural rules:

-> Each command must be written on its own line.

-> Each individual argument must be separated by some space.

-> The required arguments need to be provided.

-> Arguments that are not required do not need to be provided, but if you
   do, then you MUST provide the non-required arguments listed previously.
   i.e. for the "add" command below, if you want to define the initial size,
   you'll have to provide the new character's x and y coordinates too.

-> If you specified all of the required arguments, you can add additional
   notes or comments afterwards on the same line. If you filled up every
   argument (required or not), then it doesn't matter how you do it; however,
   if you left out some arguments that are not required, make sure that
   your comment doesn't trigger some unexpected results. The best way to
   do this is to just start every comment with '#' or '//' or whatever other
   symbol is comfortable for you to denote as a comment.

-> As long as the first word doesn't match one of the built-in commands listed
   below, you can write whatever comment you'd like on a new line.

For example:

Transition in 2s # This creates a smooth 2 second transition into the scene.
Wait 2s /* The transition command runs on a thread; thus, you need to include
         * this if you don't want anything to run while the transition is
         * being executed. */

IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, lines 3 and 4 will produce UNEXPECTED RESULTS because
the * character is a built-in command. However, Lines 1 and 2 are FINE because
the lines have already specified all of the required commands, and as an added
bonus, have already specified all of the commands.

-> Finally, consider the * command, which (as you'll see later) marks a button
list to create a list of buttons that the user can click. Some structural
rules regarding this one command include:

  -> The * command and its corresponding buttons must be separated ONLY by
     a newline. I.e. They must stay together.

  -> If the button label must have spaces, replace the spaces with an
     underscore (_) character. These will be replaced with spaces later
     on. If you need an underscore character, welllll... idk

  -> There must be at least 2 newlines after the last button definition.
     This is to be able to determine where the last button is defined.
     Alternatively, what I like to do is this: at the end of every button
     list, type a line with the keyword "end". For instance:

     *
     Take_the_letter 1 // When pressed, jump to the line with line-id of 1.
     Leave 2           // When pressed, jump to the line with line-id of 2.
     end               // Ends the button list declaration (space is okay too).
     // insert more code here...

I might've forgot something, so just let me know if you have any questions.
And let's meet up at the library more often :D

Oh yeah, one cool thing about this is that it's not case-sensitive. So, other
than the obvious print statement and the button labels, you can write in upper-
case or lower-case, depending on your choosing. Go wild.

HELPFUL TIPS:
------------

-> Before every return statement, unless you are keeping everything the same
   on purpose, put the following code:

   remove all
   clear-text
   reset counter

   Without "remove all" and "clear-text", when you return to the same scene,
   the text and the characters that were left over will remain.
   Without "reset counter", the counter-variable will remain where it was even
   in the next scene, since it's built into the AnimationReader class and not
   into the individual scenes themselves. Since the AnimationReader is in
   charge of reading all the scenes in the game, I guess you could call it a
   "global" variable. And as for the text and characters, you could call them
   "local" variables... but we'll get into that later.

   Of course, you could also be super conscientious and reset the counter
   variable before every loop you use it in. Now that I think about it, that's
   probably a better thing to do.

   (In case you're wondering, the counter variable just lets you loop through
   a certain animation a certain number of times, kind of like a for loop.
   But we'll get into that later with the "goto" command.)

   You could always take a look at the code for the AnimationReader on
   my GitHub page :D

#1: add
-------
Syntax:
add [global|local] [name] [char-id] [[x]] [[y]] [[size]] [[absolute|relative]]

- "global": Attempt to retrieve a global character that is used in multiple
            scenes.
- "local": Create a new, local character within the current scene only.
- name: The name of the character. The following names are available:
          1. enemy
          2. mob
          3. jason
          4. paul
          5. rick
          6. sam
          7. shin
          8. heather
- char-id: A one-word identifier used to identify the specific character later
           on in the animation file.
- x [optional]: The initial x-coordinate. Note that the window extends on the
                interval [0, 1000], but you may choose a coordinate outside this
                range. Also note that the character will be painted on the
                center of this x-coordinate. The default value is 0.
- y [optional]: The initial y-coordinate. The window extends on the interval
                [0, 500] here, where 0 is the top and 500 is the bottom. Also,
                the character's base/feet will be painted on this y-coordinate.
                The default value is 0.
- size [optional]: Sets the size of the character, where 1.0 is the size of the
                   reference height, a value greater will increase size, and a
                   value less will decrease size. The default value is 1.0.
                   Alternatively, you could use a percentage: 100% (or 100.0%)
                   is the size of the reference height.
[optional]
- "absolute": Sets the reference height to the height of the window. This is
              the default value.
- "relative": Sets the reference height to the character's current height. The
              default value is instead "absolute", but it doesn't matter much
              here since the default character size is the height of the
              window.

#2: remove
----------
Syntax: remove [add|char-id]

- "all": Removes all characters in the scene.
- char-id: The one-word identifier that's used in this case to identify the
           unique character within the scene to remove.

#3: move
--------
Syntax: move [char-id] [x] [y] [[speed]]

- char-id: The one-word identifier that's used in this case to identify the
           unique character within the scene to move from one place to another.
- x: The x-coordinate to move this character to.
- y: The y-coordinate to move this character to.
- speed [optional]: The speed to move the character with in pixels per second.
                    The default value is 1/10 the width of the window; with
                    the 1000-pixel-wide window that would be 100 px/s.
